HandyMouse is an innovative Python project that allows you to control your computer's mouse using hand gestures captured by your webcam. Say goodbye to traditional input devices and experience a new way of interacting with your computer!

*HandyMouse in action: Controlling the cursor with hand gestures*

## ✨ Features

- 🖱️ Move the mouse cursor using your index finger
- 🖱️ Click by bringing your thumb and index finger together
- 🎥 Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- 🖼️ Visual feedback on the video feed

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandyMouse.git
cd HandyMouse
pip install -r requirements.txt
python handymouse.py
```

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandyMouse.git
cd HandyMouse
```


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```plaintext
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```


3. Install the required packages:

```plaintext
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the script:

```plaintext
python Mouse_Gesture.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

HandyMouse uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to track your hand and interpret gestures:

1. 📷 Captures video feed from your webcam
2. 🖐️ Detects and tracks hand landmarks using MediaPipe
3. 👆 Maps the position of your index finger to the screen coordinates
4. 🖱️ Simulates mouse movements and clicks using PyAutoGUI


## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Camera not detected
**Solution**: Ensure your webcam is properly connected and not in use by another application.
- **Issue**: Hand not tracking accurately
**Solution**: Adjust lighting conditions and ensure your hand is clearly visible to the camera.
